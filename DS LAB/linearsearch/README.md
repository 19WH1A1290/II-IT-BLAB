#    Linear search with out recursion
## Aim : write a program for linear search
### step-by-step procedure

1.First create an array of numbers which is given as input to the program
2.Now take the value to be searched(Key value) from the user and compare the value with all the elements of array
3.When the key value is matched with one of the elements of given array then program return the position of the value 
4.If any of the elemnt is not matched with key value then it return "the value not found"
